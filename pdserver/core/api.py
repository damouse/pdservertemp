'''
Builds the external API dynamically by scanning for functions that begin with 'api_' in 
the target module. These methods are exposed as xmlrpc methods to the internet at large. 

Methods can be called internally (and tested without having to boot
the server.) 

If you're poking around in here looking for something, you're in the wrong place.
